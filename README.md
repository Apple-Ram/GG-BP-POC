I prefer to not be too explicit about the nature of this project,  as giving more details would make it easier for people to find it and potentially resell it. I hesitated to publish it, all my repositories are usually private, but I think that developers, with or without this, already have their own solutions anyway.  So I decided to make this public, mainly to show how poorly designed this "Kernel" AC is.
